Hello! I'm Sudheer Ahmed, a passionate 3rd-year Software Engineering student at SMI University. My academic journey has ignited a strong technical interest in full-stack web development, where I actively explore both frontend interfaces and backend systems to understand how they create seamless digital experiences.

I'm currently pursuing an 8-week internship at Kohaq to bridge classroom knowledge with real-world application. Through this opportunity, I aim to:
1️⃣ Gain hands-on experience in industry-standard web development practices
2️⃣ Earn a professional certification to validate my technical skills
3️⃣ Build a foundation for my future career in technology

I’m excited to contribute, learn from industry experts, and turn this experience into a launchpad for my professional growth."
